MatthewMatthew is my third blog. One might ask: is yet another blog *really* necessary? Yes and no. While this blog won't cure polio or Zika, I need another outlet. My [portfolio blog](http://matthewhicks.design/journal/) is focused on my design projects and career. My [other blog](http://matthewhicks.nl) is an exercise in writing in Dutch.

This one is different. It's more personal. Allowing me to become a little more goofy, a little more vulnerable, and perhaps a little more nuisanced.

Because I'll write whatever I want. About the creative process, about writing, about living in Europe. I hope this site allows me to share more, without worrying about what others might think.

Of course, we're all mulilayered, multidimensional beings. We're full of various interests and contradictions, and I want to embrace that. This blog just makes it easier - for me - to share.

So, writing more, sharing more, even if I'm vulnerable... this I will do.
