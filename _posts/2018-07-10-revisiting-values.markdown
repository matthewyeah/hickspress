Last weekend I read an interview with [Shawn Sprockett in the Techies Project](https://techiesproject.com/shawn-sprockett/) where he was asked: "What is really exciting to you about your work? What are things youâ€™re super proud of, what are things that really activate you right now?"

If I were to answer this very quickly, I'd say that it was exciting that my work involves transforming lives through travel and education. But this is a very expected, somewhat drinkin'-the-koolaid response. I just finished a project that I was on for a year and a half and am wanting to dig a little bit deeper into what "activates" me.

If I go into my past, the work that I was most excited by involved stories of people finding themselves in this world, and how technology can facilitate that process. How transgendered people can get access to healthcare through a website. How blind or deaf people can travel using an app. How older people can use technology to meet others in real life so that they're no longer lonely. Essentially, I am activated by how marginalized people can use technology to better their lives.

I must press forward toward what activates me, what makes my soul come alive. As I wrote yesterday, God is not distant, but rather close to our heart, close to who we are. Same with passions and interests - they don't come from looking outside, but from looking within.
