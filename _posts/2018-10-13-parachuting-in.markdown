I'm no Jan Chipchase, traveling to the far reaches of earth to discover unknown user behaviors. But over the years I've worked with midwives in Uganda, HIV/AIDS rights activists in Seattle, humanities scholars in Holland, research oncologists in Basel, and Finnish kids wanting to travel to learn a language - so I know a bit about interviewing different types of people with vastly different life experiences from mine.

As UX researchers and designers it's important that we know how to parachute into situations in which we're unfamiliar. At the pharma company Novartis I'd interview scientists with deep expertise, and I'd have to quickly become familiar with their workplace jargon so that they could speak freely and get to the bottom of what I was actually trying to discover.

In project teams, a 'subject matter expert' served as the critical bridge between scientific knowledge and design. These experts explained complex scientific information to the tech and design teams. Before most interviews, I'd sit with this expert and go through the words and concepts I'd expect to hear during the interview.

When parachuting in, it's important that we take the vocabulary of the person we're researching. If you stop the conversation and ask them to clarify too much, then they might adopt the same mindset as a kindergarten teacher would with their kids. Or they might never get to the "meat" of what you're trying to discover because they think it would be too complex.

To design meaningful products, I had to make sure that the scientists were speaking on a similar level with me as their colleagues. That they felt free to tell me exactly about their workflows and their pain-points, without my lack of knowledge getting in the way.

But it's not only expertise I've learned how to navigate, but also when a person I'm interviewing is vastly different from me in terms of ordinary life experiences. For example, when I interview 10 year olds, I have to "parachute in" to their mindset, their way of thinking. Help make them comfortable very fast. One of the ways I do this is by asking about their best friends, hobbies, music tastes, or favorite weekend activities. After they tell you, even if it's totally unrelated to your research, I've found it opens them up to a more productive interview experience.

To navigate effectively into other peopleâ€™s worlds is a very important skill. Prepare for what you might encounter, use their vocabulary, and make people as comfortable as possible, so you can bring their stories back into designing meaningful products.
