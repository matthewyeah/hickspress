2017 was a difficult, but encouraging year. I realized that I was depressed and needed to do something about it. I began going to therapy and in December I moved to my own apartment - my first apartment of my own - and have just begun to feel what it's like to be independent.

I've never lived alone. After graduating high school I moved with my best friend Sarah to Tacoma, then to Seattle. In Seattle I moved in with my partner who I have been living with up until December (a little more than nine years). It's so strange to have my own place - where I can play loud music in the mornings and go to bed whenever I want (even as early as 9pm). Where I can decorate however I want, and cook whatever I want. Read books and watch movies whenever I want.

Moving isn't everything but at least it's something. Moving is action, and action means that something - whether good or bad - is happening. I had to take action to shake myself out of the depressive slumber I've been in for so long. To feel what it means to be alive, to be me again.
