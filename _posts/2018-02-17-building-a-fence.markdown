<br/><br/>


I just started reading Pirkei Avot; a book focused on Jewish ethics. The maxim to "build a fence around the Torah" resonates with me most so far. The Rabbis interpreted this to mean to keep the essence of the laws intact even with modern demands. But to me, "build a fence" means to keep what's sacred, sacred. To honor and love the Torah is to build a fence around it, to hold it up as extraordinary. And when you protect it, you understand it better. It becomes a part of you, and you learn how to incorporate it into your own life.

But don't only build a fence around the Torah. Protect all that matters to you. Your passions, peace of mind, and your ability to stay healthy, both physically and mentally. Your potential to learn and grow and become a better human being. Don't let social media or the news or stupid habits or complacency get in the way of your ability to make the most out of your own life. Develop your boundaries. Keep what's sacred, sacred - build a fence around what matters most.
