In early July I asked myself: what activates me? What makes me truly passionate about the work that I do? And as I considered this question over the following months I finally came to the conclusion: I love asking questions, I really enjoy finding out about people's lives, and I get great satisfaction from putting user insights into product. 

Over the past two years at EF I've been the primary researcher on all of our projects, as we've had no dedicated UX Researcher. Before EF I was working as a designer in the research division of Novartis with also no dedicated researcher. So doing research - contextual inquiry, workshops, interviews, surveys, etc - was always an absolute critical part of my work. But I never thought I would do it full time, until I presented some research findings I did last April and then again in early August that convinced me - and senior leadership in my team - that this is the direction I should head.

But WTF, Matti? You're a designer, you love pixels, you love code, you love color and typography and flows. Yes I do! I still do. But I also love writing interview scripts, conducting fieldwork, designing surveys, asking hard questions. I love diving deep into the questions, and being surprised by what people tell me. I love communicating findings to the creative and engineering teams, and getting them excited about asking questions and pursuing their own research.

So where am I headed, what I am doing? I'm becoming more of a UX Researcher*.

If you have a similar experience of pivoting from one discipline to another - or if you're just plain antidiscipline, I'd love to connect.
