Why don't you say something? Why don't you share something? 

Events in recent weeks has led me back to this blank page, to write about what I know and don't know. An unacknowledged but deeply felt fear that I've had, for not being perfect, for not writing things the right way, for not showing you the most pixel-perfect designs, the fear that I am somehow lesser than what I have in my mind.

This, has kept me from sharing. From saying: "Hello world, here I am, here are my writings, here are my designs. Let's connect, let's share - together". And I'm sick of being quiet, of not saying things or showing things for fear of being wrong. Well, I am wrong sometimes, or dammit, much of the time. That's part of being human. Being imperfect is human, it's natural.

And it's true: the work we show should be good, or we should strive as much to make it as good as possible. But don't let that striving keep you from expressing yourself. Saying how you feel, or trying to get an idea out.

Seeing my friend Mike play last week in ZÃ¼rich and Lausanne, reading Amanda Palmer's The Art of Asking, following @kseniaanake, and other things (like meditating) has gave me new confidence and energy to just go for it.

So, I'm going to smile and be imperfect. Be bold. This is what I'm telling myself now, to smile and be bold.
