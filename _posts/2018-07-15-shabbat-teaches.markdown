<ul>
<li> Take off those headphones. Be a part of the world. </li> 
<li> Connect with your friends and family. You have very little time with them left.</li> 
<li> Sing your heart out. Your voice is good enough.</li> 
<li> Walk slower and listen. To breathe and feel the ground beneath your feet.</li> 
<li> Taste your food. It's entering your body, becoming a part of you.</li> 
<li> Sleep. You never get enough on any other days.</li> 
<li> Meditate. Find peace with yourself and your world.</li> 
<li> Pray with your community. You soul rejoices with G!d when you do.</li> 
</ul>
