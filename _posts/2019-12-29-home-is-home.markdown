On the way to the airport after a week of being in Kansas City for the holidays, my mom said: “I wish you could stay home.” “But this is no longer my home, mom,” I said, looking at the flat rural landscape of Missourian nothingness.

But is Zürich really my home? On the one hand I have work here, my synagogue, my books,  my friends. But I don’t have the love for a city - still - that I feel for Amsterdam or New York. I don’t have the Swiss German. I don't have my dog.

But does it matter where home is? Shouldn’t the world, ultimately be my home? Through meditation and reading poetry, I am beginning to think it should. What does matter is who I am inside, the inner work that I do to be comfortable no matter where I am. As an evolving human, I'm always traveling. Whether physically or mentally, the goal is to keep pushing towards my own direction of becoming.

“Home is home,” I told my mom in the car, trying to tell her that I no longer belong in Missouri. She replied: “Yes, you’re right. Home is home.” But someday, I’d like to be able to say "Home is home" and mean that I am exactly where I am supposed to be. I am present where I can close my eyes, feel my beating heart, and know that I am home.
