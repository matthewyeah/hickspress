Several months after my friend [Daniel](https://www.google.com "A Raucous Life") died, I was preoccupied with whether I would also die young. Accidents notwithstanding, I was practically raised on fast food, one of my parent's smoked, and I was a frequent sunbed goer in my late teens. Do any of these things constitute death? No, but still my mind wondered.

Last December my dear Angelique unexpectedly passed away, and the question arrived again: am I next? But I have to remember who Daniel and Angelique were - they died young yes, but they were so full of life while alive. They lived incredible lives, even in the short time span they were here. And so, it does a disservice to my life to raise this question.

But allow me to just answer it: Matti: you will die young. Perhaps at 32, 40, 60, or even as old as 90. As long as you keep learning, keep growing, keep meeting great people, keep taking care of your health, keep loving your God, keep immersing yourself in life - you will surely die young. 

This is a promise I'll work to keep.
