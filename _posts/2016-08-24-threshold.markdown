I've struggled with this concept in the past, both as a designer and writer. The concept of "creative threshold", or rather, when the right time is to share your work. To show what you're doing on a personal project.

We most likely don't have the resources to do multiple iterations or have a thorough analysis done on our creative work. But we have to get it out to the world to show what we've done. When is the right time? When do we know we've reached the point where we can show our work?

Ultimately, it comes down to the questions your trying to answer by showing your work, and the end goal you have in mind. 

If you're trying to prove your a "breathrough" artist, you're going to be disappointed - because these types don't exist. Rather, the idea of a 'breathrough' artist is a myth, because the individuals who are called 'breakthrough' have worked for many, many years studying and practicing the craft.

As this incredible Michel Phelps piece shows, the honing of a craft happens in the dark. And when you're ready to open it up to the light, you have to be prepared for what you want to get out of it.

So, if we want to show more work, then what do we have to do?

**1. Get used to it.**
