Last month I was browsing a bookstore, looking for Daniel Gordis's "We Stand Divided", a book about the conflict between American Jews and Israel. They didn't have it, but I did see "Here All Along" by Sarah Hurwitz. Intrigued, I picked it up, browsed through a few pages, and then put it back on the shelf. There are a lot of Jewish books published every year, and it just seemed like another Abi Pogrebin's "My Jewish Year" which I read a few years ago.

But I couldn't get Hurwitz's book out of my mind. I don't know what it was, but something compelled me to learn more about what it's about. At the time I had several other books in my online bookstore cart, like volume 2 of Shai Held's ["Heart of Torah"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33156130-the-heart-of-torah-volume-2?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=H0OGRRT4LA&rank=1) and a [new Haggadah](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/opinion/sunday/passover-covid.html) from Tablet magazine. But I randomly added "Here All Along" as well. For whatever reason, I felt a strong pull towards the book.

When I got the book, I immediately started reading, and I could't put it down. Yes, she was a Hebrew school drop out, yes she's one of *those* going-to-Shul-only-two-times-a-year Jews (I note this with no disrespect). But over the past five years, Hurwitz went on a journey through Judaism, engaging with the Torah and Talmud, learning about the liturgy and ethics, becoming more familiar with the history, and ultimately, learning how to make Judaism her own.

On a personal level, I needed this book. It was like having a conversation with a mentor or friend and them saying: "Okay, these might be difficult texts, but engage with it, make it your own". Ever since reading the book I have dived deeper into the weekly Torah readings, been more focused on the meanings behind the [Piyyutim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyyut) we sing in Shul, and begun a more intentional practice about how I incorporate rituals into my life. 

Hurwitz is critical of taking bits and pieces from many different religions and appropriating them into your life. Instead, one should choose a religion and focus, letting it become a vessel for personal and spiritual growth. [She says](https://youtu.be/1FIeOBXSkCs?t=486): "There's a danger in consuming different faith traditions that only affirm your existing approach to life, and I think there's something helpful about engaging deeply with any faith tradition and letting it's wisdom challenge you, and then you challenging back. These are ancient religions and they need to be interpreted with heart, mind, compassion, and love."

Hurwitz's book came to me at the right place and time. Something within me needed it, and I couldn't be more grateful. 

Yasher koach, Sarah!
