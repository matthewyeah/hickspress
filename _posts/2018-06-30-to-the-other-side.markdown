*"People are accustomed to look at the heavens and to wonder what happens there. It would be better if they would look within themselves, to see what happens there." - Kotzker Rebbe*

Growing up I thought the "man living upstairs" was a mean, punishing power. When I was young, I remember one of my relatives pointing at a burning campfire and saying: "If you're not a good boy, you'll burn in there forever." As I grew older I realized I could have a new relationship with this power, a relationship that I would help me to become a better version of myself.

For me, my deepest sense of G!d is through Judaism, through the prayers and how one lives as a Jew. But others may reach a higher spiritual plane through Budaism or even some vague sense of spiritualism. This is ok. As long as you search for a peace within. As long as you can break through to your truth.

But how to break through? How can we shed our preconceived notions of G!d and arrive at a version that speaks to us, that is in line with our hearts? 

It begins with prayer and meditation and creating the space for silence. It begins with affirming what we believe by how we behave, by how we treat others, and how we make the world a better place for everyone.
