*"People are accustomed to look at the heavens and to wonder what happens there. It would be better if they would look within themselves, to see what happens there." - Kotzker Rebbe*

Last Sunday I went to a lecture about Hasidism by Rabbi Arthur Green in ZÃ¼rich. Rabbi Green said that many Hasid view themselves as having a direct, intimate relationship with G!d, and this is what attracts many to Hasidism today. G!d is not some cold, stone-faced almighty, but rather an intimate spirit that you experience through prayer.

For many, connecting with a higher power is very difficult, almost impossible. Growing up I thought the "man living upstairs" was a mean, punishing power. Later on I realized that I could have a new relationship with this power, a relationship that I could grow into believing and that would help me to become a better version of myself.

But how can we break through that feeling that we grow up in - the feeling of G!d as punishment, and begin to believe in an intimate, loving power that manifests through how we treat ourselves and others? Through how we do our work and make a positive impact on the world?

Viewing G!d as a spirit within your heart, rather than existing somewhere far up in the sky is a start. Just giving another name - your personal name for what you call G!d - could be your answer. Whatever you do, just get started.
