Some parts about getting older are great. I can eat pizza whenever I want, own as many pets as I desire, and practice the religion I choose. But some parts are terrible, such as the terrible feelings of self-doubt that constantly plague us as we get older.

A few years ago I told my friend Erik: "I am going to write a Medium post on designing technology for scientists." He shook his head and said: "Why Medium? Don't you just want to write?" I didn't know how to answer, and just quickly changed the subject.

For some weird reason, writing on Medium was a scary undertaking. It was official. It was like me coming out of hiding.

Why haven't I ever posted on Medium? To be honest, I was afraid. People would actually *see* my writing, might actually read and respond to it.
