I thought when I graduated college I'd have to hide a part of myself to create and build a good, solid professional life in design. To the archive went all the LiveJournal posts I'd written since 1999, the photobucket pics, the short stories. Now I had to create a personal brand, I thought.

But I was wrong in a way. Yes, I do have to curate myself, to build a good reputation. But I don't have to separate myself from what other things I love - such as writing and music - and tie myself to the mast of one interest. After some years in the industry, I realize that I can be bring the unique parts of myself to design. I can combine what I love and make something out of it.
