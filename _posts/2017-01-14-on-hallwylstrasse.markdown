Yesterday a woman on my street tried committing suicide by jumping off of her balcony. She screamed “Why why why why why?” in German while police stood down below, figuring out what to do. My neighbors were doing the same thing as I: wondering, will she jump?

I got off my balcony and went into the kitchen and ate some chocolate. Curious, I went back to the balcony and the screaming had stopped. She had jumped, and on the ground was a bright light, and medics surrounding her body. And then I heard her screaming again. Almost the same, but now a little hurt. Screaming what? I wasn’t sure. But she lied there, on the ground. And I went back to the kitchen and finished my chocolate with a shaking jaw.
