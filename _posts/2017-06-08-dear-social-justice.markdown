I am sorry for neglecting you for so long. I moved to Europe, got a regular 9-5 job that paid well, and became almost hopelessly complacent. I have recently awakened to the fact that time is passing me by, and I have a responsibility to make the world better. For myself, my family, my friends, and my world. 

How can I best serve you, social justice?

 	1. By paying attention. I know I shouldn't only read the New York Times, Politico, and Huffington Post. There's a lot more to read out there, including Democracy Now!  
 	2. By remembering who I am. I have long been passionate about animal and women's rights. Also, as a gay man, I owe it to my community to serve the LGBTQ+ community.  
 	3. By taking action. Fighting for a better world doesn't only mean being angry about how things are, but doing something about it. I want to participate in protests, donate more money, and write about the injustice I see in the world. Lately I have been following Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz on his Valley Beit Midrash channel, and his passion for social justice, animal rights, LGBTQ rights, and religious pluralism inspires me.  
 	4. Take care of yourself. If you are unhealthy or working too much, you can't be effective at helping others. Focus on having a balanced diet, exercising, and meditating for a more even-keeled mind. The world is a crazy place, and you should act as a stabilizing force within it.

Tikkun olam - it's on us.

Sincerely,
Matthew
