Last weekend I became alarmed when I discovered that Livejournal was bought by a Russian company. What would happen to all the entries I wrote from 2002 to 2010, a period in which I transformed from a small town Midwestern high school student to an informatics student at the University of Washington in Seattle?  Not that the entries are well-written, but they document my struggle of making rent, supporting myself through school, and having my first real relationship.

So, I stayed up until 2am on Saturday backuping up all my entries. Then I realized the entries had photos - where were they? Oh yes, Photobucket, another internet dinosaur on the verge of collapse. So I backed up those photos too.

Why the urgency to save these things? Why not let them disappear into the ether? Well, because they are me. This past year has been such a struggle. Splitting from my partner, moving into my own flat, making my own life again. Who the hell was I? I had to remember.

What I discovered is that I created a narrative to get through, a strong narrative of being a poor, struggling student from a working class background. I was so self-absorbed, thinking that I was the only one who had to work full time to support himself through school. But if I consider the context, all of my friends in the University District had parents helping them. Most had parents living a short distance away. I didn't have that, so it's understandable I built this struggling narrative around me.

But then I became not such a struggling student, when I attended the UW and started doing research. Then I moved to Europe and got a job in Switzerland, making a good salary. So my original story was lost. But what was my new one?

It helps to go back, to connect the dots to figure out where you are today.
