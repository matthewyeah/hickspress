I can't remember the last time I stayed home during my birthday. Usually it's off somewhere - last year in Capri, the year before in Sicily, the year before London. This year I wanted to be home because I've been traveling so much, and I just began to like where I live.

To like where I live. What a weird, crazy feeling. Foreign to me. Is this a part of turning 34? Becoming older? Wiser? Being more comfortable in your own skin, your own place? Perhaps I'm becoming more ok with who I am and where I am.
