I fit my life into a dream.<br/>
All of it<br/>
My spirit<br/>
As it walks its own little<br/>
way<br/>
through the murky world<br/>

My thumping heart<br/>
responds<br/>
to the call<br/>
through the fog<br/>
an endless yet marvelous<br/>
blanket<br/>
of gray â€“ disguising<br/>
the way ahead

and I smile<br/>
because my thumping heart<br/>
responds<br/>
to<br/>
a heightened awareness<br/>
a brightly lit feeling<br/>
that something is<br/>
out there<br/>

waiting for me.
